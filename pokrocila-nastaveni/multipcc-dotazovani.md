# MultiPCC requests

This feature allows you to set up, search and get offers from multiple markets. The offers are clearly displayed together in one list and one currency. The prices reflect fares and availabilities from eg. Germany, Austria, Ukraine and any other countries. The MultiPCC functionality fully supports currency conversions and a wide range of settings, such as when and where to search in which countries, including statistics of successful searches.

In this section, you can create profiles for sending requests to PCCs other than the default one set up in [Agency profile](profil-agentury.md).
