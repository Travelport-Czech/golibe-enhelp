# Service fee from airline commission

This is a special and less used alternative to adding a service fee to the ticket price. Instead, you use the airline commission as your profit. You would do this in case you don't want to increase the ticket price for your customers anymore but you consider to display the price right from the reservation system because you know that the airline gives you a commission \(eg. 9 %\), which is then your profit.

In this case, you can follow the steps described in the chapter [Service fees](../zakladni-nastaveni/untitled.md) and set your service fee to 0. This way you don't increase the price, however you won't be able to see in the list of bookings how much you earn on that ticket. And you won't be able to lower the ticket price by a part of your commission from the airline.

You can share your commission with your Dealers and to waive a part of your commission to lower the ticket price for end customers. 

Example of calculation:

Fare: CZK 1 250  
Taxes: 3 900 CZK  
The total price displayed to customers: CZK 5 150  
Your commission: 9 %

It means that you will see in the list of bookings:

* Price of the Fare decreased by 9 % \(112.5\): CZK 1 137.5
* Service fee \(9 %\): CZK 112.5

You can set up the commission calculation under **Price -&gt; Service fees - agency**.

If you decide to share with your Dealer and you give them 50 % of your provision, you will see in the list of bookings:

* Price of the Fare decreased by 9 % \(112.5\): CZK 1 137.5
* Service fee \(9 %\): CZK 112.5
* Commission: CZK 56.25 \(to be paid to the Dealer\)

You can set up the discount for Dealers under **Price -&gt; Service fees - dealer**.

If the Dealer decides that he shares 30 % of his 50 % as a discount off the price displayed to customers, you will see in the list of bookings:

* Price of the Fare decreased by \(\(\(9 % \(112.5\)\) + \(30 % of 50 % \(56.25\)\) = 16.875\) = 129.375\): CZK 1 120.625
* Service fee \(9 %\): CZK 112.5
* Commission: CZK 56.25

You can set up the discount for customers under **Dealers**.
