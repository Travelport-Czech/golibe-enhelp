# Login page for registered customers

Your customers can log in at any point of their booking process in GOL IBE.

But you may want to have a separate login page. Its URL is:

[https://XXXX.golibe.com/index.php?forceStep=FullLoginForm](https://XXXX.golibe.com/index.php?forceStep=FullLoginForm) \(replace XXXX with the URL of your GOL IBE\)

{% hint style="info" %}
You can disable new registrations in GOL IBE and allow only the existing users to log in \(this login page then cannot be bypassed\).
{% endhint %}
