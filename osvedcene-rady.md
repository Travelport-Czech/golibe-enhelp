# Proven tips

We've got a few tips for you that may seem obvious, however we highly recommend that you have a look at your website and GOL IBE implementation and consider whether there's nothing which would completely unnecessarily hinder your success.

**Stop for a moment, have a look at your online booking engine and tick off diligently the following points one by one so that you have a clean conscience that you've done everything correctly just like you wanted to.**

## Search form on your website

* **Are you really selling air tickets?**

Have a look at the homepage of your website through the eyes of your customer who wants buy an air ticket. Can they clearly see that you offer air tickets at all? Can you see that on your website?

* **Is the search form implemented correctly?**

Check whether the search form is implemented correctly and that it is visible entirely. It not scarcely happens that the button _Search_ is not visible or some elements of the form don't work as they should. That's a roadblock your customers won't get through, whatever traffic your website gets. Is everything displayed correctly?

* **Can your customers see everything correctly in the most frequently used browsers?**

Take a look at the statistics below which show how browsers are used. The statistics can be different by country and can change in time. You definitely won't make a mistake however, if you focus on the 5 major browsers and try out how they display your website and search form. If you need to precisely measure which browsers are used most frequently by your customers, start using a service such as [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/). Your web designers can certainly help you with that, and you'll be able to consider the return on your investment better along with adjusting your website to all the browsers versus the website traffic.

* **Is your website correctly displayed to all your customers?**

Be careful about adding too many measurements, third-party applications for customer communication, and loading information from Facebook etc. Some of those services may not be fine tuned and in some cases you may risk that if one of them doesn't work correctly all of a sudden and it doesn't respond quickly enough, they may delay loading of some parts of your website by up to several minutes. It does not happen often, but it may happen. Our recommendation therefore is that you test your website continuously, even on an older, slowlier computer for which a richer website can be a bigger challenge.

* **Is your website mobile responsive?**

The number of users who search through their smartphones is rising. Is your website mobile responsive so that your customers can read it and possibly book air tickets? Moreover, search engines such as Google consider responsiveness of your website as a very important parameter when it comes to rating, and this may fundamentally affect the searchability of your website.

## Air ticket sales

* **Can your customers book whenever they want to?**

Think about when your customers want to book on your website. Are they only corporate customers and do they manage to make bookings during their office hours? Or are they also individuals who want to book in the evening or during the weekend? A lot of them indeed make bookings also outside of their offices. They may check out the offers while at work, but they book in the evening after consulting their family, or just when they have more time to plan their trip. Have you set up limited working hours for your online booking engine? Can't you lose customers, if they find out that they can book on your website only sometimes? We understand it can be difficult but if you decide to have your website open 24/7, we can help you set up notifications when someone makes a booking. If you use one of the integrated payment gateways, the customer can pay instantly and GOL IBE then automatically issues an e-ticket. You can also receive email notifications only if the e-ticket cannot be automatically issued etc.

* **Do you customers have enough time to pay for the ticket?**

The price of the booking in reservation systems is standardly guaranteed for one day, and although the fare conditions often show a longer period of time, the price can change. Or the airline sends you a message to the booking that the e-ticket needs to be issued immediately. A popular solution is to set up the ticketing time limit for today or tomorrow. But be careful - if you don't have an online payment gateway, do your customers really have enough time to pay cash or via bank transfer? If not, wouldn't they go to a different website?

* **How do your search results compare with your competitors?**

You can work with the search results in different way based on your clientele. You can offer:

* shorter transfers \(GOL IBE allows you to set up the maximum transfer time for short- and long-haul flights\)
* unique results \(moreover, the GOL IBE back office allows you to set up search results for a specific airline, a specific transfer etc.\)

It is also important to check the displayed prices. It is quite usual that your competitors can have various service fees for different airliens or destinations. If the airline rewards them for a certain volume of sold tickets, the service fee will be minimal, and you may end up not selling much to that particular destination. You will be too expensive. Is that all right? Does it happen to you?

* **Do you earn commission?**

Even though commission from airlines almost don't exist nowadays, they're still around. But you have to add them correctly to the bookings. This is often so complicated that almost nobody does it. Isn't that a pity? GOL IBE does support this functionality so you can set up even very complicated commissions and they are then automatically calculated for the created bookings. Do you issue e-tickets without commissions?

## Marketing

* **Do your customers know about your website?**

Do you let your customers know that they can book on your website? If you just publish your website, it is not enough to win customers. It takes time and it is difficult to make yourself known. Do you consider informing your customers in email signatures, marketing materials, offers, confirmations, business cards etc.?

* **Do you offer loyalty programmes?**

It works everywhere so why not for air tickets? GOL IBE supports customer registration, it records the date of their last purchase, offers exports for calculating the frequency of their purchases and it allows you to set up a special service fee for a particular registered customer. Can you think of how to take advantage of these functionalities and reward your loyal customers with a special service fee or something else?
